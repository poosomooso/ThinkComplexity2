In this paper, Epstein presents an agent based model to simulate acts of civil violence at a large scale. He uses agents that serve as normal citizens, each with a level of risk aversion and perceived hardship. All the agents have the same level of perceived legitimacy toards the government/some other group. Agents are unlikely to act out when there are cops nearby, but more willing to act out if they percieve that the gains from acting out are worth the risk. Epstein uses this model in two ways: to show rebellion against the government and to show inter-group violence. Epstein wanted to show if patterns of civil conflict could be reproduced in such a simplistic model, and verifies his data against a few real world civil conflicts as well as intuition on how large scale civil conflicts should look like.
