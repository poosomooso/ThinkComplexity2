In this paper, the authors develop a model for urban dynamics through cellular automata, specifically how the amount and type of activity in a cell is influenced by the amount and type of activity in a neighboring cell. Further, each activity type has a different set of rules that governs its behaviors. For example,a cell is eligible for housing activity if it is in an area with sufficient density of transportation cells. They describe a program they made based off GIS and this model, and they then simulate a host of different situations.
