This paper models marriages in social networks and the impact of online dating, specifically in racial diversity. Before online dating, someone usually dated people they had mutual friends with, or people in their community, which were usually racially homogenous. However, online dating allowed people to meet others outside their community, which is less racially homogenous. They generate these communities using random graphs (Erdos-Renyi), and model each node's preferences using a number between 0 and 1 for its social preferences and political preferences. The authors then analyze the models and determine if the introduction of online dating has improved the welfare of society. The finding of the model is consistent with previous findings, such as the increase in interracial couples in America and that marriages from online dating are stronger than marriages from traditional means of dating.
