This paper explores supply networks and how focusing on short term or long term performance affects a supplier's success. They simulate the network using an agent based model, where each supplier at every tier is is an agent, and each agent differs by whether they emphasize long term relationships, short term relationships, or are in the middle. The authors found that short term suppliers tend to be more successful, and they re just as stable as network partners. They also found that short term and long term preferences changed considerably during periods of stress, which was validated with a real life case study.
